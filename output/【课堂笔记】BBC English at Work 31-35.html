We're locked in.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh dear. Do you remember that Tom and Anna are locked in the stationery cupboard? What are they going to do? And what will people say when they are discovered in there? I have a feeling we're about to find out…</p><p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Goodness, what's that? Anna is that you? And is that you Tom?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yes, help! We're locked in.</p><p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Don't panic, I've got the key. There. How on earth…</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>…it's not how it looks Denise. We were just… erm…</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>…just looking for envelopes.</p><p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Really?!</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yes, yes, really. The door slammed shut and locked from the inside when Tom walked in.</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yeah, she's right. Just walked in, and shut the door and bang.</p><p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Hmm. Let's just keep it our little secret shall we. (Aside to Anna) I thought you had better taste Anna!</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Ah there you are Anna, I need a word with you… Oh, you look like you've been caught doing something you shouldn't! Ha ha.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>…but I haven't.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Just joking Anna. Now could you step in to my office, we need to touch base about the European marketing strategy.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Are we playing baseball?!</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>No Anna! Touch base. He wants to catch up with you, probably to see how you're getting on. Go on Anna, let's see what he has to say.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh I see.&nbsp;That door doesn't lock does it?</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>No, I don't think so. Right Anna. Biscuit? These new peanut ones are quite nice. So how are things with the project?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Well, I've done some cold calling and have an order from a company in France.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I see. Very impressive but have they signed on the dotted line yet?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>The dotted line?</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Have they actually signed the contract yet?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Well, no, but…</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>…that's the problem. There's a rival company who's also targeting the European market called Tutti Fruity - and they'll do anything to steal our customers.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh I see.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>So, to keep our head above water, we need a clear strategy… and that's why I've put you in charge. So what shall we do?</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>I've a feeling Paul hasn't a clue – that's why he wants you to come up with the ideas.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I think you're right – but I don't know what to say.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Tell him we need to&nbsp;price the rivals out of the market,&nbsp;that means offer the lowest prices so nobody wants to buy plastic fruit from our rivals. You could say that we need to&nbsp;corner the market,&nbsp;that means Tip Top Trading dominates the plastic fruit market.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh, thanks. That's very useful.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>So Anna, any thoughts?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Lots Paul. I think we've got to compete on price.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh yes?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>We need to price Tutti Fruity out of the market. We need to corner the market so that everyone knows we are the best choice for good quality, good value plastic fruit.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I like it!</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>And… and…</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Tell him we need to&nbsp;build good relationships with our customers&nbsp;– that means we give them good service.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>…we need to build good relationships with our customers. Talk to them regularly, send them gifts… go and meet them face to face.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Face to face? Yes, great idea – just what I was thinking. If we follow this strategy I reckon there could be a bonus for us all by Christmas.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well done Anna. Very convincing. If you can put your ideas into practice you'll save the company. Let's remind ourselves of the words you used to create the European marketing strategy…</p><p>We've got to compete on price.<br>We need to price the rivals out of the market.<br>We need to corner the market.<br>We need to build good relationships with our customers.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well, things seem to be going well for Anna… or are they?</p><p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Anna! Anna! That man from France has called again and left a message. He's not happy this time. Something about us trying to rip them off!</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>What? Rip them off?</p><p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>It means over charging them or giving them poor quality goods.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>That's not fair. I'm going to have to sort this out.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>That's it Anna – go and build a good relationship with your customer!

Anna negotiated a deal with a client in France but now they claim they've been ripped off! This has got to get sorted – quickly.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh Denise, what exactly did they say?</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Something about them agreeing a price for 5,000 lemons and then being offered a better price by another company.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>That'll be Tutti Fruity – they want our business.</p><p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Sounds like they're going to get it, unless you sort it out. Maybe you should work out some new figures.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Figures? Is there something wrong with my figure – am I too fat?</p><p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>No Anna! Your numbers – work out a new price, see if you can squeeze the price of lemons – maybe you can price Tutti Fruity out of the market.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Hmm, somebody else has said that.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yes it was me Anna! Do your calculations, see if you can offer a better deal and price Tutti Fruity out of the market.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>OK. I could sell them cheaper but there would be less profit.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Well, less profit is better than no profit. And who knows, if this goes well, it might lead to more contracts. But it's down to you now to make that call.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>But what am I going to say?</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Be friendly and say…&nbsp;I'm sorry to hear you're not happy with our price. Tell them&nbsp;Tip Top Trading prides itself on quality products and good value for money. And flatter them and say they are&nbsp;a valued customer and their business is very important to us.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And what shall I say about the price?</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Tell them you can match the price of our competitors.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Match the price. Right. Thanks. OK, I had better call them.</p><p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Bonjour. Fruit Traders International.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh, erm, hello, is that Monsieur Brown?</p><p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oui. Yes.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>This is Anna… from Tip Top Trading. I was sorry to receive your message.</p><p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yes, well. I thought we were doing good business and then another company called me and offered me a much better deal.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yes, I understand. I’m sorry to hear you're not happy with our price… but hopefully we can sort something out?</p><p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh yes?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>You are a valued customer and your business is very important to us… and we would love to see our Imperial Lemons on display in the restaurants and shops of France.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>That's a nice touch Anna, well done!</p><p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>So?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>So, I've done some calculations and we can offer you a better price.</p><p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>But Tutti Fruity can offer us a good price.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I'm sure they can but… we… we…</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yes Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>…at Tip Top Trading we pride ourselves on quality products and good value and I think we can match Tutti Fruity's price… in fact I know we can beat it.</p><p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>I see. That's good to hear but…</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>We'll give you an extra 10% discount – but obviously we would like you to make a bigger order.</p><p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh, a bigger order. I will have to have a think about this.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yes, of course, but please let me know as soon as you can before someone else snaps up this offer. Merci. Au revoir.</p><p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Ah, merci, au revoir.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Excellent work Anna! I can see why she's got the job now. But will her sales tactics pay off? Let's remind ourselves of some of the great lines that Anna used in trying to resolve a tricky sales deal…</p><p>I'm sorry to hear you're not happy with our price.<br>Tip Top Trading prides itself on quality products and good value for money. You are a valued customer and your business is very important to us.<br>We can match the price of our competitors.</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Well done Anna. It looks like you may have saved that deal.</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Saved the deal? Is there a problem?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Well, Tutti Fruity has tried to undercut our price but I think I may have saved the deal we had with International Fruit Traders in France.</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Yes, Anna offered a lower price for a bigger order and they're having a think about it.</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Crumbs. If the deal's not complete I think you need to get out to France and seal the deal. I want you and Tom to fly out there as soon as possible and do some schmoozing.</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Oh! You and Tom hey?</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>That's enough Denise! This should be fun. Find out what happens next time on English at Work.

Well, this is very exciting! Paul, the boss, is sending Anna and Tom on a business trip to France. He wants them to clinch the deal with a company interested in buying their Imperial Lemons. But has Tom got more than business on his mind?</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Really? What… me and Anna… to France?</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Yes but make sure you get that contract signed. We need the business.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Yeah, yeah, of course. Are we staying overnight?</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>There's no money for that – just get there and come straight back. Oh and could you bring back those nice French biscuits that have in the duty-free shop?</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Sure. So, Anna, we're off on holiday together are we?!</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>No! But I've got to book the flights online, can you help me please?</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It's not my thing. I'm sure Denise will help. I need to go and pack for this trip.</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Yes Marge… in the cupboard… envelopes apparently… Tom and Anna… oh here she is… got to go Marge… bye. Hello Anna, everything OK?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Sort of. I've got to go to France with Tom.</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Yes, I know. I thought you'd be pleased to go with Tom, after your time in the stationery cupboard with him!</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>I was just finding an envelope Denise. Anyway, I'm worried about booking the flights online. I usually book flights at a travel agent's.</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It's company policy now, we have to do everything online – even my food shopping – but don’t tell Paul.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Oh right. So where shall I begin?</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Pull up a chair Anna and we'll log on. Right let's start with the British Airlines website. There. London to Marseille. What is the outbound date?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Going out tomorrow, back tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Business class or Economy class? I think we'll say Economy.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>That's cheaper I guess. What's this mean? Flexible or fixed?</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>A flexible ticket means you can change your flight but a fixed one means you can't – and that's cheaper so we'll choose that one. I'll book you on the 8am flight from Heathrow and flying home at 6pm. I just need to type in your full names now and select your seats. Window or aisle?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>I'll what?</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>No Anna. A seat by the aisle or by the window?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Oh, an aisle seat please, Denise.</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Good. What's your frequent flyer number?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Oh I don't have one of those.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>What's that? Frequent flyer number? Here I've got a gold status card, can you stick my number in?</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Gold status! Where did you get that?</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Oh, I've flown loads of times for business. I've done deals all around the world.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>He means he's been on lots of jollies – free trips paid for by the company – and all he's come home with is a sun tan!</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Hmm, really. Right I just need to pay now… using the company account of course.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Cool. Now, what do you think of my sunglasses?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Lovely Tom. Denise has booked you a window seat OK?</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>No! Sorry I can't sit by the window… I’m… errr…</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Yes Tom?</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Well, I mean, it's only polite that the lady sits by the window.</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Really?!</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>What's Tom like?! Hopefully he'll prove a useful business partner for Anna on the trip to France. Here's a reminder of some of the questions you may be asked when booking a flight…</p><p>What's the outbound and return date?<br>Do you want to fly business or economy?<br>Do you want a fixed or flexible ticket?<br>Would you like a window or aisle seat?<br>Have you got a frequent flyer number?</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>There you go you two, your e-ticket. Now don't forget your passports.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Thanks Denise. Hey Anna, I'm so pleased that we're on this trip together. It'll be nice to spend some time with you.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Yes and to do some business and really show Paul we are his best employees.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Oh yeah, of course… I just wondered…</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Yes?</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Is there any chance I could sit in the aisle seat?</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>I've got a feeling Anna's in for a bumpy ride.

Come on we need to get a taxi. Taxi! Taxi!</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Hello again. Anna and Tom are on a very important business trip to try and sign a deal to sell their plastic fruit to a company in France. The company has received a better offer so Anna needs to convince them that Tip Top Trading's lemons are best. Are you feeling confident Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Not really. It was OK speaking to them on the phone but seeing them face-to-face is quite scary.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>You'll be fine. Stay calm. They'll be pleased you've taken the time to fly out and see them – but tell them you're grateful for their time and recap what you told them on the phone.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Oh yes – beat the price of the competitor but get them to make a bigger order.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Yes. If they order more you can offer a bigger discount. Good luck.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Oh look, we're here now. Now Anna, I hope you don't mind me saying, but just leave the talking to me. Right?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Err, well…</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Oh, Madame Brown, ciao, great to see you</p><p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>What?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Monsieur Brown. Bonjour. I'm Anna from Tip Top Trading. This is my colleague Tom. Thank you for sparing the time to see us.</p><p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>No problem. Did you have a good flight?</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It was great. I love those little bottles of wine they give out… I kept a few with me if you fancy a glass of vin rouge?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>I think we should sit down and discuss business.</p><p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Of course.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Yeah, yeah, good idea.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Now, I believe Tutti Fruity has offered you a good price but as I said on the phone, we can beat that.</p><p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Yes you did.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Did you Anna?!</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>But to get this price you've got to buy lots more.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Anna! That's not very subtle. You need to convince them they need to buy more without telling them they have to.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>What she means is our Imperial Lemons are made with our unique laser curve technology. They are hard wearing and a joy to have on display in any shop window or restaurant.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Tom, that's amazing!</p><p><strong>Tom:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I read it on the back of the box!</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>So, we really feel that we have a product that you'll be proud to display. And to get this fantastic price you just need to place an order of 10,000.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>And we can even throw in a free sample of our new Perfect Peach range.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Each lemon comes with a satisfaction guarantee. I know you won't be disappointed.</p><p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Hmm. It sounds good. OK, I think you have a deal.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Good work Anna. Don't forget to ask him to sign the contract and tell him when he can expect the order to be delivered.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>OK. I would be grateful if you could just sign the contract. We'll get the lemons to you as quickly as we can. Tom, do you have a pen?</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Erm, no actually. It was in my bag yesterday but it's gone… it was a nice, a good one too.</p><p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>No problem. I have a pen. There you go.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Thank you. It was a pleasure doing business with you. We'll get those lemons to you in two weeks' time.</p><p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Perfect!</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Good work Anna…oh and Tom too. The contract is signed but now you have to deliver what you've promised. There are many ways to clinch a deal; here are some of the phrases Anna used…</p><p>Thank you for sparing the time to see us.<br>Each lemon comes with a satisfaction guarantee - I know you won't be disappointed.<br>I would be grateful if you could just sign the contract.<br>Thank you.

Following a successful business meeting, they've returned to the airport to discover their flight has been cancelled. What are they going to do next?</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Right, they've rebooked us on to the next flight, which is at 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Tomorrow morning?! What are we going to do until then?</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>It's OK Anna, calm down. I've sorted out a hotel… quite a nice one actually.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>But what about our new contract? I've got to sort it out!</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Anna, take a deep breath… it'll be ok. Let's go and get a drink and we'll work things out.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Anna, maybe Tom's right for once. Go and enjoy some French hospitality. You've done really well today but perhaps you should keep your boss Paul in the picture.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>In the picture? I didn't take any photos.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>No Anna! I mean keep him informed. It's always a good idea to keep the boss updated on what's going on – he is the boss after all.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>OK. I will.</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yeah, this one looks quite cosy. I'll order us a beer shall I?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I'd prefer an orange juice please.</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh really? OK then. Err, Garcon. Je m'appelle un beer et citron juice thing. Au revoir!</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>What?! No Tom! Pardon, Je voudrais une grande biere et du juice d'orange s'il vous plait.</p><p><strong>Waiter &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oui Madame.</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I think she likes you! Well, everyone likes you Anna. I like you because…</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I like you too Tom but don't you think I should call Paul and update him on what's going on… keep him in the picture?</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I dunno. Let's just enjoy this moment shall we? And besides, he'll be at his biscuit appreciation class by now.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>No. I would be happier just to call him. Could I borrow your mobile phone please? My battery has run out.</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yeah sure. You'll find his number under&nbsp;Attila the Hun.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Attila the Hun?</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Just my little joke!</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Cheeky! But hold on… what am I going to say to him?</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well, don't call him Attila the Hun! Think before you call him:&nbsp;It's good news – you've closed the deal and the contract is signed. We need to proceed with the order as quickly as possible. And say,&nbsp;I'm committed to getting the order delivered on time.&nbsp;But if you need help, ask for it.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>OK I will. It's ringing…</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Hello?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Hi Paul. It's Anna. I've got some good news!</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Hold on.&nbsp;Sorry, I'm just munching some new crumbly cream biscuits. Now, what's the good news? Is it about the contract?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yes! I've closed the deal with Fruit Traders International and the contract is signed.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Excellent news.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>To keep them happy, we need to proceed with the order as quickly as possible.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Of course, of course. So what are you planning to do?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Well, obviously, I'm committed to getting the order delivered on time but I might need some help. I wonder if Tom could…</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yes, Tom can help you. Denise tells me you have a… special chemistry! Actually, where is Tom now? Is he home yet?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>He's not. Actually Paul, Tom and I are going to stay in a hotel tonight… Hello? Hello? Oh, I've lost the signal, he's gone.</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Never mind Anna. I think he got the message. Another drink?</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Let's hope Paul has got the&nbsp;right&nbsp;message about Anna and Tom! Anyway, she's briefed the boss and kept him in the picture. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases she used:</p><p>It's good news – I've closed the deal and the contract is signed.<br>We need to proceed with the order as quickly as possible.<br>I'm committed to getting the order delivered on time… but I will need some help.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>A good day's work for Anna but now it's time for bed.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Right, well, it's time for bed. We've got an early start tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>So, where are we staying?</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>A lovely little boutique hotel, just round the corner. I've booked a room with a view.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>A room? One room?!</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Err yeah. That's all they had, actually… honest!</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Hmm. This could be interesting. Let's hope things remain professional.&nbsp; Until next time. Bye!</p><h1><br></h1>
