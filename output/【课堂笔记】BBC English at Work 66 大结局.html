All their friends, work colleagues and business acquaintances are there… such as Mr Lime…</p><p><strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Fantastic Anna, fantastic!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Yuk, Slimey Limey, I never liked him.&nbsp; Sorry about the venue Anna – but it's all we could get at short notice.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I think the office at Tip Top Trading is an ideal place for a wedding and besides the…</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>Anna! My favourite girl. &nbsp;I got here as fast I could. I thought I was the only man for you but I guess Tom has stolen that title! Your choice Anna, your choice!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh hello Mr Socrates, this is a nice surprise. Come over here and say hello to Tom.</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>Hey Tom.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh hello Mr S. Nice to see you. You're not doing any firing today are you? &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>Of course not Tom. In fact, as a kind of wedding present, I wondered if you wanted a new job? I'm offering you a chance to manage my new office in Paris.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Me?! Manager… in Paris! Well Mr S…</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom… aren't we about to get married… start a life&nbsp;together?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh yes.. erm, thanks Mr S for you kind offer but I will have to decline. I'm about to spend the rest of my life with this wonderful woman.</p><p><strong>Registrar<br></strong>Ladies and gentlemen, please could you take your seats. The marriage&nbsp;ceremony is about to begin.&nbsp;Do you Anna Jane Wijaya...</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>…out the way, give me that paper. Do you Anna Jane Wijaya take Tom Brian Farquhar Darcy&nbsp;…&nbsp;to be your lawfully wedded husband? To have and to hold from this day forward?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Ermm,&nbsp; errr…</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Come on Anna. This is the most important phrase in the whole series!&nbsp; It's 'I do'!<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh yes, of course… I do.</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>And do you, Tom Brian Farquhar Darcy…</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>…it's a deal… I do. Come on Anna, give us a kiss.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh Denise!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Ahh. It looks like Tom has signed the best contract of his career but not without these phrases:</p><p>Thank you for your kind offer but I will have to decline</p><p>It's a deal</p><p>I do!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks to everyone for making this a special day. If it wasn't for Tip Top Trading I wouldn't be starting a new life as Mrs Wijaya-Darcy.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Wijaya-Darcy? Shouldn't it just be Mrs Darcy?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I'm the boss now Tom at work…&nbsp;and&nbsp;at home!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Congratulations to Anna and Tom. We have a happy ending – let's hope Anna's journey has inspired you to learn English at work.</p><p><strong>Everyone<br></strong>Bye!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
