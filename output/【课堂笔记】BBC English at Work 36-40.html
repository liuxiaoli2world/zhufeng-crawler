You're in a good mood Anna.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, I'm just back from France, where everything went really well. It was quite an experience.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Good. You got the contract for that big order. All you need to do now is to deliver what you’ve promised.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I know.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Hello Anna. Is Tom OK? He seems really grumpy since he got back from France.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>He's fine. He just had to sleep on the sofa last night.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Really?! I'm sure that's not what he was planning. Now, did Paul mention he's got a new member of staff for you to meet this morning?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong><br>No.</p><p><strong>Denise</strong><br>Typical! Well, she's coming up in the lift with Paul now.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh, so who is she?</p><p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>It's Rachel. Do you remember? She’s the woman who Mr Socrates recommended. He says she's brilliant and&nbsp;allegedly&nbsp;one of his best employees… oh, here she comes now.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>…and this is our office. Ah, Anna, there you are. Did I mention before you went to France, that Rachel is joining us for a while?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>No.</p><p><strong>Paul</strong><br>Ah… well… here she is. This is Rachel.</p><p><strong>Rachel &nbsp;<br></strong>Hi!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Hi. I'm Anna. I work here as a sales executive.</p><p><strong>Rachel<br></strong>I know. You're quite new aren't you, ya?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Not that new. She's just won a great contract for us. Anyway, looks like you two are going to get on like a house on fire. Anna, I'd like you to, sort of, work alongside Rachel.</p><p><strong>Rachel<br></strong>Alongside? Shouldn't I be in charge?</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yes… it's just, you know, you're not familiar with our office and Anna is, sort of, across this new contract… so… if you don’t mind?</p><p><strong>Rachel&nbsp;<br></strong>OK. Just for now, but don't think I’m going to be told what to do.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I'm sure you won't be Rachel but maybe we could help each other?</p><p><strong>Rachel &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I'll try.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Good! Oh dear. This is awkward. I've never worked with anyone like&nbsp;this&nbsp;before.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp;<br></strong>Well, now's your chance Anna. Rachel may be awkward to manage but try these phrases which may help things go more smoothly. Say, "I understand you have lots of experience so I would like to use your skills to help with the task." And, "Together we can do this job really well." But why not just start by making her a cup of tea. Good luck!</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh thanks. Rachel, would you like a cup of tea? And then we could talk about this contract.</p><p><strong>Rachel &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>I don't drink tea. Let's just get down to business.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh, right.</p><p><strong>Rachel &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Now, I think you need to check your stock and make sure you've got your oranges.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Err… It's lemons actually.</p><p><strong>Rachel<br></strong>Whatever. Just get them and… you know… put them in a… thingy… a box.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well, actually… I understand you have lots of experience so maybe we could you use your skills for this task?</p><p><strong>Rachel &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well, it's true, I do have lots of experience. Thanks for recognising that.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>So maybe… we could work on this job… together?</p><p><strong>Rachel &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh ya, sure. Great. Of course. I can get hold of these oranges… err… lemons, pronto. I know a man who can get some second-hand ones, it'll save us loads of money.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>But what about the quality?</p><p><strong>Rachel<br></strong>Quality?! It's the cost we've got to worry about. Keep up Hannah.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Anna.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Come on Anna. Don't let her boss you around. It's time to stand your ground. If she causes trouble say "let's discuss this so we can agree on a plan of action" or "please respect my decision and let’s move on."</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp;<br></strong>Hmm, OK, I'll give it a try. Rachel, I like your enthusiasm but… can we discuss this so we can agree on a plan of action?</p><p><strong>Rachel<br></strong>Of course. Why didn't you say? Come on discuss… discuss… talk!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, we pride ourselves on quality products and our Imperial Lemon is particularly good… and I think our client is expecting that. So I would like to send them what I had promised in the contract.</p><p><strong>Rachel<br></strong>Oh ya, I see. But I'm not really sure you're right.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, if you could just respect my decision this time and we can move on?</p><p><strong>Rachel<br></strong>Well, just this once Hannah. But I think I'm going to have to talk to Mr Socrates about you.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well done Anna for standing your ground. It can sometimes be tricky working with a new member of staff, but it's important to try and develop a good working relationship – remember business comes first! Let's hear those phrases again:</p><p>I understand you have lots of experience, so I would like to use your skills to help with the task.<br>Together we can do this job really well.<br>Let's discuss this so we can agree on a plan of action.<br>Please respect my decision and let's move on.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Hi Anna. Can't believe we were in France this time yesterday.</p><p><strong>Rachel<br></strong>Oh hello, Tommy boy. Long time no see! This&nbsp;is&nbsp;a nice surprise.</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Err… mmmm…</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Have you two met before?</p><p><strong>Rachel &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>We certainly have. Hey Tommy boy?</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh no!</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Ha ha. Looks like Tom is lost for words – let's hope he finds them in time for the next episode of English at Work. Bye!</p><p><br></p><figure class="img-box"><img class="cut-off-3 loaded" src="//i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/71bf2cd56882a2e97f8b3477c9256f8b09f361d3.png"></figure><p><br></p><h1><span class="color-purple-04">37&nbsp;Rachel the rabbit!</span></h1><p>Anna is struggling to work with Rachel, Mr Socrates' favourite Sales Executive.

It's another busy day at the offices of Tip Top Trading…</p><p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>And I said no John, not at my age, I'd rather take the bus…</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>…yeah Pete, that's great, so we'll deliver 2,000 bananas by Friday. Let's have a beer soon… yeah… cheers mate.</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>But there are two people who are busy annoying each other…</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>So you did what?

Ciao.</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Anna, has Rachel gone out?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>She's a bit of a man-eater. She almost ate me once.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>She eats men?</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well, not exactly. I worked with her in my last job. She was always listening in to other people's conversations and she's always changing jobs. That's why they call her Rachel Rabbit – you know, big ears, always jumping from one job to another.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Rachel Rabbit! That's funny. So she isn't that good then?</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh, useless! She only worked for Mr Socrates because her father threatened to sue the company, after one of our plastic pineapples fell off a shelf and broke his toe. But, better keep that under your hat.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>My hat?</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>I mean, keep it secret.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh right, I see. Well, now she's ordered loads of second-hand oranges to send to our new customer in France.</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>But they wanted Imperial Lemons?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>I know. I'm not sure what to do, so I'm going to have to speak to Paul about this.</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yes it's a good idea to refer up sometimes – ask the boss for advice. Say to him "I'm concerned that Rachel has made a mistake that might affect the business". You might also say "she's not pulling her weight", meaning she's not doing the work she is supposed to do. And you could say "I'm finding it very difficult to work with this person."</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Right. I'll try. There's Paul now… Paul, could I have a word please?</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Of course, Anna. Let's go in my office. Now, how can I help?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Err, well, it's Rachel.</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yes, amazing woman. Mr Socrates' favourite.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>I know… but&nbsp;I'm finding it difficult to work with her.</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh why's that?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>I'm a bit concerned that she's made a mistake and it might affect our business.</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Golly gosh. Really?! Why's that?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well, she's ordered second-hand oranges for our new client in France.</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>That's marvellous… isn't it?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well, I asked her not to. They wanted lemons… new Imperial Lemons.</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Ah… not so marvellous. Anything else?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well, speaking personally,&nbsp;I don't think she's pulling her weight.&nbsp;She doesn't seem to do any work and just keeps going out to buy cappuccinos.</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well, that's just not on. Look Anna, I will look into this straight away and see if I can sort this out. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. Now, I think you've earned a custard cream.</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>So Anna has expressed her concerns to Paul, the boss. It's up to him to investigate. As long as you have a fair reason to complain about a difficult member of staff, these are some of the phrases you could use:&nbsp;</p><p>I'm concerned that she's made a mistake that might affect the business.<br>She's not pulling her weight.<br>I'm finding it very difficult to work with her.</p><p>I wonder how Paul is going to handle the situation?</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Ah, there you are Rachel. Nice cappuccino? Could you step in to my office for a moment… I'd like a word.</p><p><strong>Rachel</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Ya, sure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Ooh, I wonder what that's all about. Do you know Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Hmm, no idea.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>She's probably going to get a promotion and a pay rise… and a custard cream!</p><p><strong>Rachel</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Thanks Paul, ciao. What a great guy he is. Such a great sense of humour! Looks like we're doing some good work Anna!</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Wwwhat?!</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Oh Anna.

Anna is finding it hard to work with new employee, Rachel. She's told Paul, the boss, about Rachel's incompetence but he’s done nothing about it. &nbsp;</p><p>So Anna, how are you feeling today?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Frustrated. All that work I put in, getting the contract for Imperial Lemons and Rachel has sent out a load of second-hand plastic oranges!</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>I guess you're going to have to call your client and sort out the mess.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I guess so. Oh hi Tom.</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Is she about?

Look I managed to call the guy she bought the second-hand oranges from, and I cancelled the order.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Phew, great!</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yeah, yeah… and last night I managed to order some Imperial Lemons and sent them to that company in France – Fruit Traders International. Here’s the paperwork.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Tom, that's brilliant!

New recruit Rachel has been making life difficult for Anna; she's been making some bad business decisions. Let's find out how Anna can save the day.</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Right, we've definitely got to do something about Rachel… definitely… only, I'm a bit busy at the moment.</p><p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Sorting out your dinner date are you Tom?!&nbsp; So Anna, have you spoken to Paul about this?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yes I have, but he didn't do anything.</p><p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Hmm, well he is your boss so I think you've got to speak to him again. Take him some biscuits, that might get his attention.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well, I'll try</p><p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh and keep notes so you have a record of your conversation.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Denise, you're amazing. But where have the pens gone to?</p><p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>That&nbsp;is&nbsp;strange – we all seem to be losing our pens. Here, use this old pencil.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Thanks.</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Anna. Are you happy complaining officially about Rachel?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Not really but what else can I do? She's been spoiling all the work I've been doing.</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yes she has. OK, well tell Paul the facts and tell him you want action.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>OK. Right, here goes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Come in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Hi Paul.&nbsp; I really need to speak to you about Rachel. She really is messing things up…Paul?</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Sorry, just counting my biscuits. What were you saying? Rachel? Great girl, isn't she?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>No she's not.</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Paul, she's already sent out the wrong order and now she's upset our new client. Plus, have you seen the way she dresses? I'm not happy and I think you've got to take some action.</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Anna, you're on fire! But stick to the facts, don't get personal about Rachel.</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Well I'm sure Mr Socrates would disagree with you. Look, if she is as bad as you say then I'll give you my permission to discipline her – give her a warning.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>What! Me?</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>You know what's she done wrong so tell her not to do it again…and besides, I've got an important meeting to go to… and they usually have those delicious shortbread biscuits. So …I'll leave it with you then?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>What a useless boss!&nbsp; Anna are you happy about what to do next?</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Not really. What am I going to say?</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It's not easy but keep calm and professional and say to Rachel, "you've made some serious mistakes" and "you need to consult me before you contact any of our clients." Give her a verbal warning saying "These mistakes cannot happen again, otherwise I will have to refer the matter to someone higher." This may lead to disciplinary action but it may be for the best.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh it's all very serious but I suppose I've got to do it.</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Good luck!</p><p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Anna! Darling! What's wrong? I saw Paul and he said you're in a bit of a mood.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>It's not a mood Rachel. Can we talk please…now?</p><p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Yeah sure. Let's sit here, shall we – not in that chair – that's my favourite.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Rachel, I wanted to let you know that&nbsp;you've made some serious mistakes.</p><p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh!</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>You have really upset our new client – and you think it's ok to sell second hand plastic oranges.</p><p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Calm down. It's business, darling.</p><p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>It's not&nbsp;good&nbsp;business Rachel.&nbsp;These mistakes cannot happen again. If they do I will have to take matters higher and it could result in disciplinary action.</p><p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh! You're quite scary for a short girl.</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>That was unnecessary! But well done Anna for keeping cool and calm in a difficult situation. Let's hope Rachel has got the message. Here is a reminder of the phrases you could use when giving someone a verbal warning…</p><p>You've made some serious mistakes.<br>You need to consult me before you contact any of our clients.<br>These mistakes cannot happen again otherwise I will have to refer the matter to someone higher.</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Let's find out how Rachel is behaving.</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Ah hello, Rachel.</p><p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Tommy boy. Come and give me a hug. Opps!</p><p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Our pens! All our pens! You've been stealing them! Rachel!</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>What's going on? I say, what are all those pens doing on the floor?</p><p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>They're from Rachel's handbag. She's been stealing them!</p><p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>What? The company's pens?Right, well, I need to see you in my office please Rachel, now…if you don't mind.</p><p><strong>Anna/Tom/Denise&nbsp;<br></strong>Gasp!</p><p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>So Rachel is the pen thief!

The answer is at the bottom of the transcript below.</p><h1>Transcript</h1><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Could I have a word Anna, in my office?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Hello again. I wonder what Paul wants to say to Anna? Could it have something to do with Rachel, the pen thief - or is it just to do with biscuits?! Let's find out. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Have a seat… so well done for speaking to her. Stealing all those pens from the office was the final straw.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>She was stealing straws?</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>No, no. It was the final thing that she did wrong – and it meant disciplinary action. I've had to 'let her go' – in other words, sack her.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh, so she's gone. But what is Mr Socrates going to say? She was his best employee.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Leave it with me. I’m sure he'll understand…I hope. Now, I wanted to speak to you about your appraisal.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>My appraisal?</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yes, we do it every year. It's a chance to talk about you, talk about the highs and lows of the past year and look forward.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Highs and lows? But I haven't been walking up any hills.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>No Anna! He means your appraisal is about reviewing your performance and setting objectives for the year ahead.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>I see. But what are objectives?</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>These are tasks for you to do, to try and improve your performance and skills and help the business. Here are the questions you’re likely to hear in an appraisal:&nbsp;<br>What's gone well for you this year?<br>What didn't go so well?<br>What should you do more of?<br>Let's look ahead and set some objectives.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Right. Thanks. So Paul, when shall we have this, err, appraisal?</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>If you've time, we could make a start now?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Oh OK. So I need to think about my performance first?</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Exactly. What has gone well for you this year?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Well I guess I've just done my job.</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Anna! This is your chance to sell yourself. Think about the deals you've made, the people you've managed, that sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Right. Well, I did complete two big contracts for the Imperial Lemon…</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>You've had plenty of compliments for that. You seem to have a zest for selling!</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Err, right… and then there was dealing with Mr Ingle in the warehouse.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yes, that's a good example of dealing with difficult staff. And what didn't go so well?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Well… erm… working with Rachel… and cold calling I suppose. That wasn’t easy.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Ah yes. But you soon warmed up! And what should you do more of?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Err, erm…</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>It's a tricky question Anna – but don't be ashamed about admitting things that you feel you could improve on. Nobody's perfect! Think about skills you'd like to improve.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh OK. Well Paul, I guess I could… develop some ideas for new products? Continue to work on the European marketing strategy... sell more Imperial Lemons… err…</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>That's enough Anna!&nbsp; If you do all that, you'll put me out of a job!</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh, I don't want to do that!</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Now let's look ahead and set some objectives. Biscuit?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Biscuits as an objective? Oh I see…no thanks.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>We've all got to improve our sales targets so I'm asking all the team to make an extra ten sales deals this year.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh, ten, that’s a lot.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>It is - but I know you can do it. And you mentioned developing new products, well I'd like you to do just that – but not plastic fruit, I'd like you to develop a plastic vegetable. Potato, carrot, that sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Gosh. Well, OK.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh and one more thing. Could you help Denise sort out the stationery cupboard? It's a right mess.</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Err...</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>That's a lot of objectives for Anna. She's got her work cut out for the next year. Appraisals are a good time to review your work and plan what you are going to do next. Here's a reminder of the kind of questions your manager may ask you:<br>What has gone well for you this year? Give me some examples.<br>What didn't go so well?<br>What should you do more of?<br>Let's look ahead and set some objectives.</p><p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>So if you could write up your appraisal and have it back to me by Friday?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Of course Paul. Thanks. See you later.</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Oh hi Anna. Are you still on for dinner on Friday?</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yes Tom!</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>What's going on?!</p><p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>A mouse… a mouse! I've just seen a mouse running out of the stationery office.</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Was he stealing the pens?!</p><p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>It's no joke. Quick…there he goes!</p><p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Leave him to me! Oh… oww!</p><p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Tom… Tom? Are you ok?</p><p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Uh oh! What’s happened to Tom? Has he broken something? Join us next time to find out. Bye!</p>
