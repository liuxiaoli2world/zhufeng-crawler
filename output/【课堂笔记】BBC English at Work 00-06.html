Thanks for joining me on English at Work - a new series of programmes set&nbsp;in an office, full of top tips to help you learn some useful business language which you&nbsp;could use in the workplace. In the next few minutes you can join me on an introductory tour around one of London's&nbsp;biggest imitation plastic fruit manufacturers, called Tip Top Trading. We're going to hear&nbsp;from some of the employees that work so hard to keep the business running smoothly. So come on then! Let's step into the office and eavesdrop on Tip Top Trading's possible&nbsp;newest recruit. I say 'possible' because she is still being interviewed for the job of Sales&nbsp;Executive…</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience: I've spent&nbsp;several years working in sales and I get on with people easily. Well, I&nbsp;mean, apart from the ones I don't like of course! Secondly, I know Tip Top&nbsp;Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies in London, and I want to&nbsp;be part of that.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>That's absolutely right. Tip Top Trading is the fastest-growing company in&nbsp;the plastic fruits sector.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well said, Anna! If she gets that job I'm sure she'll be an asset to the company. The decision is in the hands of Manager, Paul, who we heard there. He's a nice guy really, a little disorganised, but when things go wrong he's got to take charge…a bit like this…</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Yesterday was not a great day. Two clients came in with serious&nbsp;complaints. Mrs Kumquat received a delivery of imitation bananas that&nbsp;were purple – not very convincing, and Mr Lime ordered grapefruits, but&nbsp;got pineapples. Tom!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, listen...</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Were you responsible for these errors?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Well... yes, but -</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Look, mistakes happen. But it seems that Mrs Kumquat left our offices&nbsp;even angrier than when she came in and she says she will never use Tip&nbsp;Top Trading again!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>I tried my best.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Hmmm.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Ah yes, Tom! I hadn't warned you about Tom, one of the company's top Sales&nbsp;Executives – he's good….</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>[on phone] Tom speaking. Yah! Frankie! So what's the latest, are we on?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>…but his interpersonal skills need working on. Listen to this!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>My computer has crashed. I've lost my phone. And there's a big, BIG&nbsp;problem with my timetable. I have two meetings scheduled at the same&nbsp;time with two extremely important clients. I can't do them both at once!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>See what I mean! Now, every office needs a good office assistant – and Tip Top Trading&nbsp;is no exception. It's got Denise, who's there to assist, organise and sometimes make the&nbsp;tea…</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh sorry excuse me, here's your tea Paul.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Thanks Denise.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>But goodness! She likes to talk…</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Really! "Denise do this! Denise do that!"\I'm telling you Sharon, I've almost&nbsp;had enough! I get treated like I'm some kind of servant!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>That's Denise! I think we'll just leave the office now and let them get on with their work. So that's Tip Top Trading. There are plenty of other people we'll meet along the way –&nbsp;so go on – why don't you join me for English at Work from bbclearningenglish.com. See&nbsp;ya!</p><p><span class="font-size-16"></span></p><figure class="img-box"><img class="cut-off-3 loaded" src="//i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/71bf2cd56882a2e97f8b3477c9256f8b09f361d3.png"></figure><p><span class="font-size-16"></span><br></p><h1><span class="color-purple-04">01&nbsp;The Interview</span></h1><p>Tip Top Trading is the fastest-growing company in the plastic fruit sector, and Anna desperately wants to be a part of it. Her job interview for a position in sales is going to be a challenge. How will she cope?</p><p>Phrases from the programme:</p><ul class=" list-paddingleft-2"><li><p>A good example that comes to mind…</p></li><li><p>I'm particularly proud of…</p></li><li><p>Timekeeping is important to me.</p></li></ul><h1>Transcript</h1><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hold tight please! This is Anna, on a bus going to an interview for a job as a sales executive at Tip Top Trading – one of London's fastest growing companies. How are you feeling Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, a little nervous but I really want this job.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well don't worry Anna, as long as you say the right things, you'll be fine.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>The right things!? Like what?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>You need to sell yourself, be confident, not arrogant and give examples. Like: A good example that comes to mind. I'm particularly proud of. Timekeeping is important to me.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh right. Thanks. Perhaps you can come with me?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Sorry Anna, you're on your own now – but we'll be listening in. Look! You've just arrived. Good luck!</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Come in. Hello, I'm Paul, the Manager of Tip Top Trading. And you must be….?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>It's Anna.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Yes, very good. Thanks for coming. Now somewhere in this pile, I've got your CV…</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Err, is that it there?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh yes, thanks Hannah. Your qualifications look impressive but what sales experience can you bring to our company?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I worked in a shop once.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>: Ohhh Anna! Sell yourself. Give a good example!</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>: Oh right…mmm….well a good example that comes to mind is when I was involved with a campaign to promote and sell a new range of clothes – I loved doing it and it was…</p><p><strong>Denise</strong>: Oh sorry, excuse me, here's your tea Paul.</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: Thanks Denise. Now Anna, it looks like you've achieved a lot during your time at university. Could you give me an example of good team working during your time there?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Sorry! I forgot the sugar.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Thank you Denise.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Hmm, so you want an example? I was the treasurer of the debating society at university. That was OK I suppose.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Come on Anna. Be more enthusiastic – the debating society is exciting!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I mean… I'm particularly proud of how I organised the finances for the debating society. We had a very small budget and I had to make decisions on what to buy.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>I like it! "I'm particularly proud of" - Positive but not boasting. You're doing well.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Very impressive – so you're a good planner Anna! We like organised people here... ooops, silly me. I seemed to have spilt tea over your CV.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, do you need some help?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh no…I'm sure it'll dry out… carry on please…</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Also… timekeeping is important to me…</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>"Timekeeping is important to me" – that's good!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I always try to complete my work on time. At university I never handed my assignments in late.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>That's good to hear. We like punctuality here…</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Excuse me Paul. Sorry it's a bit late – but I thought you might like a biscuit with your tea.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Hmm thanks….oh lovely, custard creams… mmm. Now Hannah, finally I wanted to ask you what exactly made you apply for this job at this company?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Errrr… ooo… well. The reason I applied is….</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Yes, yes, yes Anna? Do you need a bit more time to think?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Errr…mmm…</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>What's she going to say? How would you answer that? Join us next time to find out. Before we go, here's a reminder of some of the great lines Anna's used today… A good example that comes to mind I'm particularly proud of. Timekeeping is important to me.

Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading, where Anna's&nbsp;interview for a sales job continues. When we last said goodbye, Tip Top&nbsp;boss Paul had asked Anna why she wanted the job. First she said:</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Errr... mmmmm...</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Since then, she's added:</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Mmmm... errr...</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>And as we join her again, Anna is saying:</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, errrr... I'm errr.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Come on, Anna! If you can't think of the word you need, find another way&nbsp;of saying it.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I am...

Yes, that’s it. I am really motivated.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Good! Why?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Now over to you Anna; structure your answer!

(knock on the door) Denise! Is everything alright?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>No Paul, it’s not. Everything is not OK!</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>You look pale.

We're still in Anna's first week in the&nbsp;busy offices of Tip Top Trading. How's it going Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Everything's still so new to me. I keep needing to ask people for help!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, that's only natural at the beginning. To ask people politely for help use the words would and could. You can also use the word please, but don't make the mistake of thinking's enough to make what you say polite.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Er, ok.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Hello Anna!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh hi, Paul!</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>I was wondering if you could do something for me?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes of course.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Would you be able to print out a file for me? It's a document on CBL –&nbsp;Convincing Bananas Limited – they're one of our suppliers. The file should<br>be on the system and could I have it in the next ten minutes please, as&nbsp;they're on their way here for a meeting?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. Oh no, I've no idea how to find it! Tom...?!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Er, ask Denise. She should know.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Ok, thanks Tom, I'll ask her.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>(on the phone to Sharon) I'd warned her, you know, I said 'Victoria, if you&nbsp;don't change your hairdresser</p><p><strong>Anna</strong><br>Denise?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>One day you'll… hold on a moment. Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Please email me the background file on CBL.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Er!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>(on the phone) Who does that girl think she is?... Anna... new girl... I told&nbsp;you about her... yes with the saucepans, that's the one. She's only been<br>here five minutes and she's already acting like the Queen of Sheba...&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh and Denise, please send it to me within five minutes, Paul needs it soon. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Really!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>He he, good to see who's the boss, eh Denise?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Really!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Er, Anna, I think you've upset Denise...?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Upset Denise?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>You were a bit rude when you asked her to help.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Was I?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Remember what I said Anna. Just using ‘please’ to ask someone to do&nbsp;something can sound a little rude.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Instead of saying 'Please send me the file' you could say 'Could you&nbsp;possibly send me the file?' or 'Would you mind sending me the file?'</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh! English is so confusing! I'll try to remember that. Oh no, the printer&nbsp;isn't even set up! Tom?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Please help me with…I mean, could you possibly help me with the printer?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Er... I need to finish this email to a really important new client.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>But it's really urgent. Would you mind writing your email later?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Okay, since you asked so nicely. Let's have a look...</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, it's a good thing Anna has understood how to use 'could' and 'would'&nbsp;to ask for things, before she upsets anyone else. Let's hear those phrases<br>again:</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>I was wondering if you could do something for me?<br>Would you be able to print out a file for me?<br>Could I have it within ten minutes please?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Could you possibly help me with the printer?<br>Would you mind writing your email later?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>The printer seems to be working well, but how well are Anna and Denise&nbsp;working together? Are these two going to be enemies?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Really! 'Denise do this! Denise do that!' I'm telling you Sharon, I've almost&nbsp;had enough! I get treated like I'm some kind of servant!</p><p><br></p><figure class="img-box"><img class="cut-off-3 loaded" src="//i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/71bf2cd56882a2e97f8b3477c9256f8b09f361d3.png"></figure><p><br></p><h1><span class="color-purple-04">06&nbsp;Double-booked</span></h1><p>It's chaos at Tip Top Trading. Tom is in a panic and needs help! He has arranged more meetings than he can cope with and is going to have to face some unhappy clients. Anna decides to step in and help.</p><p>This episode explores language for offering help.&nbsp;Phrases from the programme:</p><ul class=" list-paddingleft-2"><li><p>Is there anything I can do?</p></li><li><p>Let me help.</p></li><li><p>Can I give you a hand?</p></li><li><p>Give me a shout if you need anything.</p></li><li><p>I have an idea!</p></li></ul><h1>Transcript</h1><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>‘Look forward to hearing from you soon. Kind regards, Anna.’</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>(on the phone) ... And Margery said: 'I don't think I've ever seen a&nbsp;vegetable quite that size before...'</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Where's that hole-punch?!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Ah, business as usual in the offices of Tip Top Trading.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh for goodness sake! What a disaster! I can't believe it!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>But one member of the team seems bothered.<br><br><strong>Tom<br></strong>Arrgh!<br><br><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna, this is the moment to show you’re willing to help.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Use phrases like 'Is there anything I can do?' 'Let me help!' or, to be more informal, you can say, 'Can I give you a hand?' or 'Give me a shout if you need anything!'</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Right.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Go on!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Are you okay Tom?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>(grumpily) No.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Is there anything I can do?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>(grumpily) No.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh. What's wrong?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Everything.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I see. Can I give you a hand?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>My computer has crashed. I've lost my phone. And there's a big, big&nbsp;problem with my timetable. I’ve got two meetings scheduled at the same<br>time with two extremely important clients. I can't do them both at once!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Let me help.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Thanks Anna, but these are big, big clients. They need someone of&nbsp;experience.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, give me a shout if you need anything!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>I can handle this, alright?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>'I can handle this'... ungrateful idiot. But you used all the right phrases Anna, well done. Anyway, I bet he'll change his mind.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Oooh, I know, and the purple ones are so much more powerful...</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Anna? Could you help me?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Ha! I told you so!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>They've both arrived at once! Oh god! I'll deal with Mrs Kumquat...</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Okay.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>You talk to Mr Lime, he's from a company called Citrus Ventures. They own&nbsp;hundreds of juice bars.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Are you sure that's a good idea Tom?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>I don't have much choice, do I?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Well I could</p><p><strong>Tom</strong><br>Just keep him occupied Anna, tell him how great he is... no, no, tell him&nbsp;how great I am. Find out what he wants. If it's about the - well, never<br>mind, just be nice.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Understood.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Mr Lime! Are you well?</p><p><strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Yes, but I'm actually rather angry too.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Ah, well let me introduce you to Anna!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Mr Lime, it's a pleasure to meet you! Let me help with your coat.</p><p><strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Oh er...

Thanks.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Now, please come this way and you can tell me what's wrong.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well done! Anna used some good phrases to step in and help with this&nbsp;mess. Let's hear them again:</p><ul class=" list-paddingleft-2"><li><p>Is there anything I can do?</p></li><li><p>Let me help.</p></li><li><p>Can I give you a hand?</p></li><li><p>Give me a shout if you need anything.</p></li></ul><p>But Mr Lime is obviously upset about something.
