Just talk!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Just talk! Just talk! You just talk! What on earth am I going to say? My mind is blank.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Try to remember the key points you wanted to share, and give them one by one. If you can, give some facts that support each point. For example:<br>Tip Top Trading is growing fast – our number of clients doubled last year.<br>Use phrases like this:<br>The company has a strong track record of...<br>Let me share with you...<br>The Imperial Lemon's key strengths are...</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>OK.

This is because our company has a strong track record of reliability and because, thanks to new technology, our fruits are more and more convincing. Our bananas have won awards for being the most authentic-looking fruits in Europe. We are very happy that Citrus Ventures is already among our clients and we hope to build on that by offering you more exciting new fruits. Let me share with you our latest product: the Imperial Lemon.<br>The Imperial Lemon's key strengths are its design and flexibility. It is made with revolutionary faux-orange-premium, laser-curve-definition technology...&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>What an excellent performance from Anna. She focussed on some key points, supported them with facts and structured her answer clearly. She also managed to relax and sound more natural.

We're back at Tip Top Trading. Anna is very busy dealing with Mr Lime's big order for Imperial Lemons.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes?... Who?... I can't hear you. Mr what? What? Mr Who? I don't know, you tell me. Oh, you are Mr Hu... H-U: Hu. Er... No, Tom's busy. Call back later. Bye.

Bye! Right, now where was I?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Anna, could I have a word?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. Ohhh, he must want to tell me how pleased he is with the Citrus Ventures deal.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Now, Anna... biscuit?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>I'm a little bit concerned about something.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>"I'm a little bit concerned..." Doesn't that mean something bad?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Yes, Anna, Paul is using a polite turn of phrase to say he is unhappy about something. Let's see what he's got to say....</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>I think you need to work on your telephone manner.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Work on my telephone manner?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>It means the way you talk on the phone is not good enough and you have to improve it – to work on it to make it better.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Perhaps you should think about …</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Perhaps you should think about – that's a polite way of telling you to do something!</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Anna, are you listening to me?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, sorry, I was just sort of, err, talking to myself. Could you repeat what you said please?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Right, I'll start again. I said: I'm a little bit concerned about your telephone manner. You need to work on the way you speak to clients. Perhaps you should think about being a bit more polite to clients; it's important for the image of the company.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh okay.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>You can go now – take another biscuit with you – that's my last chocolate wafer, you lucky thing!</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Anna?

And I think Tom actually mentioned it to Paul.</p><p>But, look, I'll help you if you like. I'm a bit of an expert on the phone. I'll give you some lessons.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh thank you.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Come in early tomorrow morning, before the others get here and we'll practise.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thank you Denise, that's very kind.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Wow! Denise is actually being nice to Anna. Amazing! Although from what I've heard of Denise on the phone, she's only ever gossiping with friends. Paul was very gentle and polite in the way he explained to Anna there was a problem and that she needed to improve some things. He used these phrases:</p><ul class=" list-paddingleft-2"><li><p>I'm a little bit concerned about...</p></li><li><p>You need to work on...</p></li><li><p>Perhaps you should think about...</p></li></ul><p>Let's see if Denise manages to teach Anna anything useful next time.

Paul is walking towards her, eating a biscuit, he looks a bit bothered.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, Paul.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Come and have a biscuit in my office.<br>Now Anna, about Mr Lime.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I didn't say yes!</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Pardon? Yes to what?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, nothing.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>You sent him an email yesterday and copied me in.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Your email reads: boxes ok. pls c-d-u cfirm wnt 300 ta.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes: please could you confirm you want 300.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Right. Now that's not really the best way of writing an email to a client, is it?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Please could you re-send your message to Mr Lime, using actual words that make sense.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Okay.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Thank you. Have a chocolate crunchy!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Morning Anna.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Hello.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Let me guess, Paul just spoke to you about your email?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>How do you know?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>You copied me in remember, I just read it – or tried to.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>But what's the problem? Other people write like that!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>No, maybe some people write text messages like that in an SMS message on their phones, but that is completely the wrong style for an email to a client.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Okay Anna, let's stop listening to Tom, he's a waste of space. These are the kinds of phrases you need in a business-related email:<br>Dear Mr Lime...<br>I hope you are well.<br>I am writing regarding...<br>Please could you confirm...<br>Yours sincerely, or<br>Best wishes.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thank you! I'll rewrite my message. There! I'd better get it checked before I send. Denise?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>(On the phone) yes... the other problem with Stephanie is that her legs are just too long...</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, she's on the phone.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>... yes, like trees...</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I'll have to ask Tom. Tom?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Mm?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Could you read this through before I send it?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Hang on, Anna, let me just finish this sentence. It’s really important. I’m ready, let’s have a look. Okay. (reading) Dear Mr Lime, I hope you are well. I am writing regarding your request for luxury boxes for the Imperial Lemon Delivery. We will indeed be able to supply them. Please could you confirm that you want 300. Best wishes, Anna.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Well?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>It’s good, it's much better. Send it. Hopefully Mr Lime will think your last message was just someone sitting on your keyboard by mistake.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>You're not...</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>What?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Nothing. It's none of my business.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>What?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>You're not ever going to go to lunch with Mr Lime are you? I mean, in a non-business way...</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>No of course not!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>I mean I don’t care… it's just... important to... stay professional.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hmmm.... well, I had a feeling Anna's email was going to cause problems. But at least she won't make a mistake like that again. Here’s a reminder of the phrases she used in her new, improved email.</p><ul class=" list-paddingleft-2"><li><p>Dear Mr Lime...</p></li><li><p>I hope you are well.</p></li><li><p>I am writing regarding...</p></li><li><p>Please could you confirm...</p></li><li><p>Best wishes.</p></li></ul><p>Until next time, bye!</p><p><br></p><figure class="img-box"><img class="cut-off-3 loaded" src="//i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/71bf2cd56882a2e97f8b3477c9256f8b09f361d3.png"></figure><p><br></p><h1><span class="color-purple-04">19&nbsp;The open window</span></h1><p>How do you explain if there's been a mix-up? Paul, the boss, leaves a message. He wants ideas for a new marketing strategy for their new laser-curved fruit range. Anna gets straight down to work but when Paul turns up, Tom gets all the credit. There's a big mix-up and it's time for Anna to learn some language that explains there has been a misunderstanding.</p><p>This episode focuses on politely saying there has been a misunderstanding.</p><p>Phrases from the programme:</p><ul class=" list-paddingleft-2"><li><p>I think there's been a misunderstanding.</p></li><li><p>There's been a bit of a mix-up.</p></li><li><p>Let me explain what happened.</p></li></ul><h1>Transcript</h1><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello, it's a chilly start to the day at Tip Top Trading.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Hi Denise!</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Good morning Anna.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Brrr... it's so cold in here.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>The window was left open overnight.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>My papers have been blown everywhere.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Mine too! Tom was the last one here last night – it must've been him who left the window open.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Brrr.... Right then, to work! Oh, there's a note from Paul, it must've fallen off my desk: 'I would like your ideas on our stock management system for our new laser-curve fruit range, so we know we can keep up with demand. Please write me a couple of pages of suggestions and leave it on my desk. I'll be back this afternoon.' Wow! I have to come up with ideas for a stock management system! Gosh, where do I begin?!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Good morning.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Morning!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Hey, my certificate for Plastic Pear Salesman of the Year is on the floor!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Right... stock management systems... stock-up on your laser-curved lemons … My first idea is to calculate the total….</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, Anna has finished her report and left it on Paul's desk, but things aren't that simple. Er, Anna, there's going to be a problem.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh? A problem, bbbbut…</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Let me teach you some phrases you might need to explain that there's been a mistake:<br>I think there's been a misunderstanding.<br>Or:<br>There's been a bit of a mix-up.<br>Anna: But what misunderstanding? What mix-up?<br>Narrator: You could also use:<br>Let me explain what happened...</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>But-</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Ah, good afternoon everyone.</p><p><strong>All<br></strong>Hello.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Tom, this is an excellent piece of work!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Sorry?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>These are by far the best ideas you've ever had.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>I don't understand.</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>Our stock management system!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Can I see? … Oh, that's not mine.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Eh?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I think there's been a misunderstanding. I did it.</p><p><strong>Paul &amp; Tom<br></strong>You?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I got your note Paul, here.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>No, no, that note was for Tom.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, then there's been a bit of a mix-up.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Did you take that note from my desk?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>No, no!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>I suppose you threw my pear salesman certificate on the floor at the same time too!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I didn’t! Let me explain. The wind must have blown the note for Tom under my desk.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Tom left the window open overnight. Our papers were blown all over the place.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>I see, well, golly gosh. In that case, well done, Anna! Excellent work, even though you weren't meant to do it. And Tom, your ideas are still welcome of course. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Sorry Tom.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>What? Oh, I'm not bothered. I've still got some great ideas in my head anyway.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Yeah, right! Let's leave Tom to get on with his 'great ideas' and listen again those phrases Anna used to explain the misunderstanding:</p><ul class=" list-paddingleft-2"><li><p>I think there's been a misunderstanding.</p></li><li><p>There's been a bit of a mix-up.</p></li><li><p>Let me explain what happened.</p></li></ul><p>Well, the mix-up gave Anna a chance to shine – Paul certainly seemed impressed with her work. Maybe it will bring her new opportunities. Until next time, bye!</p>
