Last time we heard the team from Tip Top Trading having a&nbsp;smashing&nbsp;time at the launch of its plastic aubergine. Tom threw one at Dave from the IT department, but it missed him and went through a window!&nbsp; It's time for Paul to hand out some harsh words.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>That behaviour just isn't on.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Sorry Paul… but it was quite funny wasn't it?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>No it wasn't.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Sorry Paul, Tom was just angry with Dave. I thought he liked me but we saw him with Julie from accounts.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Really? He seemed such a decent chap… anyway, don't do it again. OK? In the meantime, you're going to have to pay for that broken window.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>What… hey? Bbbut…</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Now, excuse me, I need to take this. Hello, Paul Smith speaking. Ah, Mr Socrates… yes… ah, you've heard…</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Crikey, come on we'd better go.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>That was a good shot Tom! Looks like it's made an impact on Dave. Look, he's sent Anna some flowers.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh there's a note on it. It says "You can count on me" but no name.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>That is a strange thing for him to write.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Hmm, it is and it's not his handwriting.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Maybe a secret admirer eh? I wonder who it could be?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Are you OK Paul? You look as white as a sheet.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>I'm not actually. Mr Socrates says he's having a&nbsp;strategic review.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>A what?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>He means he's been looking at how the business is operating and how it should operate in the future.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>That sounds serious.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>And as part of his review, he says he wants to&nbsp;downsize&nbsp;and he's asked me to…&nbsp;step aside.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Why? What are you in the way of?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>No Anna. To&nbsp;step aside&nbsp;is a polite way of saying to leave your position in the company.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh. I don't understand Paul. Why?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>He says&nbsp;the company needs new direction and more dynamic leadership.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Crumbs Paul, you can't get more dynamic than you!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom! But Paul, you've been a great boss.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Thanks Anna. I guess it's the economic climate, we're not making enough money so cutting staff is inevitable.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah but you cut Denise's job.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Yes but we had to get her back because she was necessary for the smooth running of the department.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>That's right.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>But Mr Socrates says I'm 'surplus to requirement'.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, that doesn't sound good… does it?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>If Paul's job is 'surplus to requirement', it means his input to the business is no longer needed. So it's not good news.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Anyway Anna, Mr Socrates wants to know if you got his special message?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Special message? The flowers!?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>That's strange. Why is Mr Socrates sending you flowers?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>It is a bit strange. Anyway, Paul's news has come as a shock for everyone. Here are some of the phrases Mr Socrates used to break the bad news:</p><p>I've been doing a strategic review of the company.</p><p>I need to downsize.</p><p>I need you to step aside.</p><p>The company needs a new direction and more dynamic leadership.</p><p>You are surplus to requirement.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Right, I'm going to have to call Mr Socrates and find out why he's sent me flowers.</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>Socrates… who wants me?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Erm… hello Mr Socrates… it's Anna here.</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>Anna! My favourite girl. Please call me Brad. So glad you called.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I needed to speak to you about the flowers you sent me. I'm very flattered but I don't think…</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>The flowers?! Sorry honey, I haven't sent you any flowers but I have sent you an email – have you read it yet?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>No. What did it say?</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>I was saying that as I'm giving Paul the chop, would you like a promotion?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>A promotion?</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>Yes. You have been an outstanding member of the team so how would you like to be the new manager of Tip Top Trading's London office?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>What a fantastic opportunity and one that Anna surely can't refuse – or can she? And who did send Anna those flowers with a message saying "You can count on me"? Find out what her answer is in the next English at Work. Bye.</p><p><br></p><figure class="img-box"><img class="cut-off-3 loaded" src="//i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/71bf2cd56882a2e97f8b3477c9256f8b09f361d3.png"></figure><p><br></p><h1><span class="color-purple-04">61&nbsp;Decision time</span></h1><p>Mr Socrates has sacked Paul from his position as manager of Tip Top Trading and he's offered Anna a promotion to be the new boss.

Mr Socrates has sacked Paul from his position as manager of Tip Top Trading and he's offered Anna a promotion – to be the new boss. But will she accept?&nbsp; What's wrong Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I feel bad about replacing Paul. He's been good to me.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>It's business Anna. He's just not up to the job – but you are.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks. But why me? Can I do the job? I'm not as experienced as Tom.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>I think we have seen over the year that you definitely have more experience than Tom! Go on Anna, you can do it.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Hmmm.</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>So Anna… what do you say? Will you replace Paul as the new boss of Tip Top Trading? Come on Anna. This promotion recognises your achievements at the company. It's an opportunity of a lifetime.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I know.</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>You'll be my right-hand man.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>I think he means right-hand woman! It means you'd be his most trusted and invaluable assistant.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I see.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna, if you need time to think you could say "thank you for your kind words" and, "could I have time to consider your offer?"</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Erm, Mr Socrates. This news has come as a bit of a shock. Thank you for your kind words but please could I have some time to consider your offer?</p><p><strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>Oh… OK Anna. But don't leave it too long. I have a habit of changing my mind.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>OK, Mr Socrates… I mean Brad… I'll call you back soon.&nbsp; Bye.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh… has Mr S offered you Paul's job by any chance?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>And you said you'd think about it?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. I'm not sure if I can take on that much responsibility.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>It's easy peasy. I could do it standing on my head.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>But he's not offering­&nbsp;you&nbsp;the job Tom.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Please don't mention this to Paul… not yet… he's very upset.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>I know nothing!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>You know nothing? About what?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>I mean, I'll remain tight lipped… I won't say a word… until it's all official like. You can count on me.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>"You can count on me"!?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Uh?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>"You can count on me". That was the message with that that bunch of flowers someone sent me. It was you wasn't it?!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Well… err… I suppose… yes… it was me Anna. I couldn't help it. I… I… love you Anna.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Do you know what Tom… I quite like you too… I think you're… sweet.&nbsp;Now come on and give me a kiss.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh crumbs, shall I come back later?!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>No it's ok Paul. We’re just… getting to know each other a bit better. In fact, Anna… I'd like to ask you something.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh, why is Tom getting down on one knee?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>I expect he's dropped one of his contact lenses.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>No it's not that. Anna, I'd like to ask you something… err… will you… will you marry me?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>What?!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Crikey, what a dilemma. Now Anna's got two important questions to answer. Will she take the job as Tip Top Trading's newest and youngest manager? And will she marry Tom?&nbsp; Here's a reminder of what Mr Socrates had to say about her:</p><p>This promotion recognises your achievements at the company.&nbsp;</p><p>It's an opportunity of a lifetime.</p><p>You would be my right-hand man.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>And if Anna accepts the job, here's what she could say:</p><p>I'd be delighted to accept. Thank you.</p><p>When would I start?</p><p>Could we discuss the terms and conditions of the new job?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Let's find out what Anna has to say.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh Tom, I don't know what to say. It's come as a bit of a shock. Can I have some time to think about it?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>I suppose.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Well, while you think about that, I've got some good news. I've been offered a new job.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>That's fantastic news Paul. What is it?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>It's to be Head Taster at a company called Better Biscuits.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>That's fantastic news Paul.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, well done Paul. That's right up your street.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>So Anna, does that mean you'll do Paul’s job now?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Don't answer that. Answer my proposal first.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>No, I think she should sort out her work first.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>But I've been waiting to ask her for months.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>I think it's up to Anna to say what she wants.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Quiet! Look everyone, I can't decide what to say to you Tom, or Mr Socrates. So I've decided I'm going to take a short holiday to have some time to think.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Good idea. Where shall we go?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>On my own Tom. When I return I will give you my answers.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Crumbs. I think I'd better get a biscuit.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>A good idea Anna. But we’re going to have to wait a while to find out what she decides. She needs a rest after learning so much during her year at Tip Top Trading. We hope you've enjoyed learning with her and now feel more confident in using English at work! That’s all from me and the team at Tip Top Trading for now.&nbsp; Until we meet again, bye!</p><p><br></p><figure class="img-box"><img class="cut-off-3 loaded" src="//i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/71bf2cd56882a2e97f8b3477c9256f8b09f361d3.png"></figure><p><br></p><h1><span class="color-purple-04">62&nbsp;Anna's decision</span></h1><p><br></p><p>Anna's been offered a promotion - and a marriage proposal at the same time!

Did you get some 'head space'?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Eh?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>He means time alone to think about the things you want to think about.

At the offices of Tip Top Trading things are a bit strange after Tom walked… stormed out in a huff after realising that Anna was never going to marry him. So Anna, I suppose you can get on with being the manager now?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, I suppose so. But something's not right.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, you've lost a valuable member of your team.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I know, and a good friend too.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, you're the boss now – it's time to deal with the situation and get down to business. Tell the team you'll be finding a replacement for Tom and you're going to make some changes in the office.
