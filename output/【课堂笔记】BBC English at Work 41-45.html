He was trying to catch a mouse but tripped over. Can Anna help soothe the pain? Let's find out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Ooh… oww… ouch. My arm really hurts.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>What's all this noise about?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>It's Tom. He's had an accident – tripped over a mouse – I mean tripped over trying to catch a mouse.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Golly gosh. Are you OK Tom?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>I dunno. I think I've broken something.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Your pencil I think! Just sit there at my desk and I'll go and call a first-aider.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Anna,you're going to have to fill in one of those Health and Safety reports.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh really? Do we have to?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>It's procedure and it's the law – it's got to be done.&nbsp; Now Tom, would a biscuit make you feel better?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Health and Safety is important in the workplace. The office needs to be a safe place to work in, but accidents do happen and that's when you have to report it. Anna, do you know where to find the form you need to fill in?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I think so. It's here on the company intranet… here it is, 'accident report form'.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Yes, it's sometimes called an 'incident or accident report form'. It will ask you:&nbsp;How did the accident happen? What was the cause of the accident? Were there any injuries? And how could the accident have been avoided?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>OK, I had better get started.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Right, I've call the first-aider. She'll be here in ten minutes. Now, do you need a hand with this form, Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes please Denise. It wants to know&nbsp;how the accident happened.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Just say there was a mouse… no, a large rat… running about that needed catching. And Tom, very bravely, tried to catch it</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes… and then he tripped over something.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Was it your ego Tom?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Err? Ha ha. Ouch! No, it was a sample box of Perfect Peaches.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>So,&nbsp;the cause of the accident&nbsp;was a box of Perfect Peaches left on the floor. Who left them there anyway?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>That might have been me Denise.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>What do I always say about putting things away? Now Anna, it says here&nbsp;'Were there any injuries?'</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>So I'll write, 'Yes, a member of staff broke his arm.'</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Sprainedhis arm. I think he'd be in a lot more pain if it was broken, hey Tom?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>What? Err, yeah. It still hurts though.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Hmm! Now finally it says&nbsp;'What can be done to avoid this accident again?'</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Get rid of the mice… I mean rats?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>No. Store things away properly and keep the office tidy, eh Tom?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, I suppose so… but I was only trying to catch that mouse.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>I know, very heroic. I'm starting to see what Anna sees in you, you know.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh no, Anna, our dinner date!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>So, it's been an eventful day in the office. Anna has done the proper thing by completing an accident report form. If you have to report an accident at work, here are some of the questions you might be asked:</p><p>How did the accident happen?</p><p>What was the cause of the accident?</p><p>Were there any injuries?&nbsp;And:</p><p>How could the accident have been avoided?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>So luckily for Anna she might get out of that date with Tom!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Hey Tom, don't look so glum. I'm up for dinner if you still are?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Ouch… really?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Sure Tom, and as you've only got one arm now, you won't be hugging me all the time.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>You'll have to spoon feed him his food too!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Denise, could you go and call pest control please?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Careful what you say Denise, or you may get injured too! So it looks Anna and Tom's dinner date is on – I can't wait to be a fly-on-the-wall! See you again soon. Bye!</p><p><br></p><figure class="img-box"><img class="cut-off-3 loaded" src="//i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/71bf2cd56882a2e97f8b3477c9256f8b09f361d3.png"></figure><h1><span class="color-purple-04">42&nbsp;The dinner date</span></h1><p>Anna and Tom are at a pizza restaurant for their dinner date, but Anna has work on her mind.

Anna and Tom are finally on their dinner date at a pizza restaurant. Eating could be difficult for Tom because he's sprained his arm after that accident in the office. He might still have romance on his mind but Anna is thinking about something else. Are you feeling nervous Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Nervous? Why?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Being out on your own with Tom. What are you going to talk about?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Don't worry. I can handle this, besides I want Tom's ideas about developing a new plastic vegetable.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>A plastic vegetable! Oh right. Well, good luck.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>So, this is nice. Finally, us together, on our own, me and you, pizza, red wine… expensive red wine, actually.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Lovely, Tom. You know Tom, Paul wants me to develop a new idea – plastic vegetables – I thought, maybe, you might like to help me?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Come on Anna, we're not here to talk business. Tell me about you – the real Anna. Have you had many… err, many boyfriends before?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>That's a bit personal. What do you think about plastic peas?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Err? Can you not switch off from work for one minute?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom. I think you and me are very similar – we're a good team. If we could come up with a great idea for Paul then who knows… we may get to travel the world selling it together?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh, I see. I hadn't thought of it like that. Right well…</p><p><strong>Waiter<br></strong>Your pizzas… madam… sir.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks. Tom, I think you'll need some help cutting that.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Thanks. Mmm, you smell nice… or is that the pizza?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I've got it!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>What?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Plastic aubergines!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Plastic aubergines?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. Plastic aubergines. They would look great on this table – a sort of decoration.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah! And you could put sauces inside… or salt and pepper. You could be on to something here.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>We need to put a proposal together, to give it to Paul. But what should we say?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna, your proposal needs to be brief but clear. Use positive language to propose your idea to Paul. Use words like 'exceptional', 'fantastic', 'quality', and talk about how it would benefit the business by using words like 'profit', 'efficiency', and 'value for money'. Good luck!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Are you OK Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. Just writing some things down.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>OK, well write down how we could target restaurants and cafes. They'll be begging for our vegetables. Oh this is so exciting… let's drink to our… succ… Oh!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom! What have you done? You've knocked red wine all over me… and my notebook.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Ermm, sorry. We had better get you out of that dress.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hmm, what a mess and what a date! But what may be lacking in romance is made up for in a potentially successful business deal. Let's find out how it's going much much later at Tom's flat…</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>…this&nbsp;exceptional&nbsp;product has&nbsp;fantastic&nbsp;potential…</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Say 'demand for this plastic aubergine will reach melting point!' My little joke.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>…by making the production more&nbsp;efficient, our customers will get&nbsp;value for money&nbsp;and our&nbsp;profits&nbsp;will increase. There, done.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Great. We can pitch this to Paul first thing on Monday morning. So now, maybe we can get back to our date? Look I saved some of that pizza.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>It's all cold! Anyway, I had better go. It's late and I want to tidy up this proposal. But it's been great. I can't wait till next time.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Bbbut…Next time?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, that went well! The pizza may be cold but Anna and Tom have developed a red hot proposal. Here's a reminder of some of the words you might want to use to make your business proposal stand out…</p><p>Exceptional!</p><p>Fantastic!</p><p>Quality.</p><p>Profit.</p><p>Efficiency.</p><p>Value for money.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>So with the proposal written, Tom and Anna just need to convince Paul – and that means pitching their idea.

Last time on English at Work, we heard Anna leaving Tom crying into his cold pizza. He may not have had the evening he was expecting, but for Anna it was a huge success. She came up with an idea for a new plastic vegetable and now she needs to pitch it to Paul, the boss.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>… so I think I'll go for the blue, Marge, it matches my eyes… well almost…</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Morning Denise!</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh, hello Anna&nbsp;…yes, Anna, bright girl, what she sees in Tom I'll never know… what?!... ha, ha, I'm sure you would…</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh hi Tom. You're in early.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Uh? Oh yeah, couldn't sleep after you'd left.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom, it was a fantastic night – unforgettable in fact. Thanks so much.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Did you hear that Marge? She said it was 'unforgettable'!&nbsp; Looks like they're getting very serious…</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>You're such a gossip, Denise.&nbsp; The only thing Anna is serious about is her new idea.&nbsp; How's it going Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I'm really excited about launching a new product, although Tom doesn't seem so keen. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Don't worry about him. You need to concentrate on convincing Paul that your new idea will bring in the business.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>But how?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>You need to pitch the idea to him but before that, you need to do some research.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, of course – research – but how do I do that?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Check out the competition, work out some costs and find out what new product people would really like to see. Why not do a customer survey?!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>A customer survey. Right. But what should I ask?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Say: 'Could I ask for your opinion on a new product we are hoping to develop?' 'What plastic products do you currently use?', 'What products would you like us to make in the future?', 'How do you feel about the idea of selling plastic vegetables?', 'Any particular vegetable you would like to see?'</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>OK, so it's like a questionnaire. I need to do some cold calling again!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Good luck!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I think I'm going to need some help with this. Tom, Denise, have you got time to help me… please?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Of course Anna.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, well it's a bit tricky with my… ouch… sprained arm. But go on. As it's you.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks. We need to call up some companies and find out how interested they would be in buying plastic vegetables.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh lovely. I love talking to people on the phone.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>You certainly do Denise!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Good Denise. If you work your way through our business directory, call our existing customers and ask these questions.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>I'll get onto it straight away.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Great, and Tom, could you help me by cold calling some new businesses?</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh yeah sure. I've got loads of contacts.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I suppose I had better make some calls too.&nbsp;Hmm, let's try this one. 7-4-3-9-1-0-0</p><p><strong>Man<br></strong>Hello. Plastic Purr-fection. Can I help you?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh hi. I'm Anna from Tip Top Trading, we make and sell plastic fruits. I'm trying some to get some opinions on a new product we're trying to develop. Can you spare a few minutes to help me?</p><p><strong>Man<br></strong>Well I'm quite busy at the moment but I'll try and help.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thank you. I'll be as quick as I can.&nbsp; Firstly, what plastic products do you use at the moment?</p><p><strong>Man<br></strong>All sorts – plastic balls, plastic fish, plastic mice…</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Plastic mice?! Oh, I see. And… errr… what sort of things would you like us to sell… in the future?</p><p><strong>Man<br></strong>Let's think… erm … more squeaky toys.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Squeaky toys?! What about plastic vegetables?</p><p><strong>Man<br></strong>Do they squeak?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Err, not really. I think there might be some confusion here. Do you use plastic fruits in restaurants and shops?</p><p><strong>Man</strong></p><p>No. We just sell plastic toys… for cats, hence the name 'plastic purr-fection'.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh I see, ha, ha. A good name, but, I'm sorry you're not really the business I was looking for. Thanks for your time anyway. Bye.</p><p><strong>Man<br></strong>Bye. Get down Tiddles!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Uh-oh Anna. It's a good idea to check exactly what type of business you are calling before carrying out your survey. Better luck next time!&nbsp; If you're doing some research and want to get the opinions of your customers, here's a reminder of the questions you could ask:</p><p>Could I ask for your opinion on a new product we are hoping to develop?</p><p>What plastic products do you currently use?</p><p>What products would you like to see us sell in the future?</p><p>How do you feel about the idea of selling plastic vegetables?</p><p>Any particular vegetable you would like to see?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Let's find out how the team is getting on.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>That was fun. I called 10 companies, asked them your questions – one man asked me out for dinner – anyway, I've created a database and put all the information there.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Well I've called 20 companies and they all say plastic vegetables would be a great addition to their range… especially aubergines!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Great. Well, I had some success too so I'll put all the results in that database.&nbsp; Thanks everyone. Oh no… what's happened? &nbsp;Denise! Denise! Everything's disappeared off the computer!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Hey, my computer's gone blank. We've lost all our documents!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh no a computer crash! Has Tip Top Trading lost all its valuable information? Find out next time in English at Work.

Or is just me?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading where, as you can hear, there appears to be a bit of computer trouble. Everyone's work seems to have disappeared. This is serious so who can sort it out?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Leave it to me. I'll sort it out.&nbsp;You just need to switch it off… and on again … like that.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Hold on, let's check… Denise! All&nbsp;my&nbsp;documents have gone now!</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh, sorry, I was just trying to help. You'll just have to call I.T. Support, look, here’s their number.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>'It' Support?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>No Anna not 'it' but I.T. Support – information technology – sometimes called Computer Support. Most big companies have them. These are the people who sort out your computer problems and get everything working again. But be careful, they might ask some tricky questions.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>OK, thanks. But what should I say to them?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Tell them:&nbsp;"I am having problems with my computer", then say&nbsp;"the screen keeps freezing"and&nbsp;"I seem to have lost some documents". Tell them&nbsp;"I have turned the computer off and on but that hasn't fixed it". Finally,&nbsp;ask if they can help – please!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, I'll give it a try. Here goes.</p><p><strong>I.T. Man<br></strong>I.T., Dave speaking, how can I help?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh hello Dave –&nbsp;I'm having some computer problems&nbsp;– in fact everyone is here.</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>Right. What system are you using?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>What system?</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>Yeah, what are you using? PC, laptop, Windows XP?</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>Tell him it's Windows 7.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Erm… it's Windows 7 on a PC.</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>Good, good, this should be easy. Were you using many applications when it crashed?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Applications?</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>Did you have lots of things open – documents, spreadsheets, videos, other software?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, I suppose I did.</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>Right, well… Anna isn't it?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>Right, well Anna, try pressing control, alt, delete, at the same time – after that try opening Windows again.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>OK. Tom, could you open the windows please.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>What eh? The windows?!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. Dave says so.</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>No, no, no. Open Windows 7 on your computer.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, silly me!&nbsp;No,&nbsp;the screen just freezes. I'm a bit worried because&nbsp;I think I've lost some documents.</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>Hmmm. In that case the only thing to do is reboot it.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Reboot it?You mean kick it?!</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>No! Reboot means turn it on and off again.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh I see. No Dave,&nbsp;I have already tried turning it off and on again but that hasn't fixed it. What am I going to do?</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>Don't panic! I'll come and have a look. You're on the 2nd&nbsp;floor right?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear. This is a bit worrying but I'm sure Dave, the IT man, will get things sorted. Remember if you have important documents, it's best to back them up on a memory stick just in case you have a problem like this.&nbsp; Let's remind ourselves of the phrases we might use if we have to call computer support: &nbsp;</p><p>I am having problems with my computer</p><p>The screen keeps freezing</p><p>I seem to have lost some documents</p><p>I have turned the computer off and on but that hasn't fixed it</p><p>Can you help, please?</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>Oh hi. Is Anna here? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>She's over there.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>So Anna, I'm just going to unplug the screen and put the wire back in here…</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>OK Tom but are you OK down there? Mind your head.</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>Excuse me, are you Anna? I've come to fix your computer.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, hello… you must be… Dave. I really like your hair.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Ow!</p><p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br></strong>Thanks. You look rather lovely. I'd better take a look at your computer.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Don't worry guys, it’s OK, I think I've fixed it!</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Looks like Tom has a rival. Is Anna going to fall for the charms of Dave, the I.T. man, or is he just going to upgrade her software? This could get very interesting – but there's still work to be done – so join us again soon for English at Work.

Look everything is working so, if you don't mind, I think we should get this pitch for Paul finished.</p><p><strong>Denise<br></strong>You'd better hurry up. Paul's taking the afternoon off to go to his biscuit lovers’ convention.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh right. Well, we might as well leave it until tomorrow then Anna.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>No Tom. There’s no time like the present – I heard someone say that once – we've got to get our idea to Paul as soon as possible. Then we might have time for a drink, or shall I ask Dave?!</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>No, no, you're right. Look, I'll design some pictures of the aubergine and you get the results of our survey together, yeah?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Great.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well done Anna. Remember to make your pitch clear and exciting. Really sell it with words like 'exceptional!', 'fantastic!', 'quality', 'profit', 'efficiency', and 'value for money'.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>OK, I've got all that. I'm just adding some of the facts and figures from our customer survey.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Anna, I've got the designs, they're coming off the printer now.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Denise, I’m off now. Can’t wait any longer for my garibaldis!</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Wait Paul! I need to tell you about our new product idea.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Well, I, I, have to go. Can you tell me about it in the lift?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>In the lift? Do I have to?</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Sorry Anna, but that's the only time I’ve got.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Right Anna. It's time for your 'elevator pitch' – an elevator is an American word for lift. You’ll need to pitch your idea quickly and concisely. You need to tell Paul what the product is and who your market is. Then talk about how you hope it will make money for the company. Talk about the evidence you have that it will be successful and convince him it will really benefit the business.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Phew, there's a lot to say in a short time but here goes.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Anna, could you just press the 0 button there, thanks.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Now Paul. Tom and I have come up with a new exciting product – the plastic aubergine.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh yes?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. This fantastic product will be a great addition to table decorations in the café and restaurant market.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Will it now? Do you really think it will be a profitable addition to our plastic portfolio?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh yes. Using the same plastics as our fruits, we can easily re-mould our bananas and change the colour. We can increase efficiency but maintain quality.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>And profits?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>By my calculations, we can increase profits by 20%. That's based on selling the same quantity that we now sell of Imperial Lemons.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Hmm, 20%, really? But do you know who’s going to buy this product?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I do. We've conducted a survey and already found 10 new companies who would buy this and 27 existing customers who have shown an interest in it…</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>…and I'm confident this new product will be a huge success.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Very impressive. You've certainly done your homework. Look, let me chew it over – probably on a custard cream – and I'll get back to you.</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks. Paul, Paul… you've forgotten your bag.</p><p><strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh yes, I'll need that. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Great work Anna! You convinced me but have you convinced Paul?</p><p>So Anna's done her first 'elevator pitch' and kept to the facts. Here's a reminder of some of the things she said:</p><p>We've come up with an exciting new product.</p><p>This fantastic product will be a great addition to table decorations in the café and restaurant market.</p><p>We can increase efficiency but maintain quality.</p><p>By my calculations, we can increase profits by 20%.</p><p>I'm confident this new product will be a huge success.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>So, how did it go Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I'm not sure. I told Paul as much as I could and I think he listened.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Good, good. So, what are you doing now?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>I've got to meet someone.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>Anyone I know?</p><p><strong>Anna<br></strong>No, not really.</p><p><strong>Tom<br></strong>It's Dave from IT isn't it? What does she see in him?</p><p><strong>Narrator<br></strong>Do you want me to answer that Tom?! Anna may have fallen for the charms of Dave but let's hope she keeps her mind on her plastic aubergines. Join us again next time on English at Work.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
