Try to be loud but don't scream, just loud enough to hear yourself.&nbsp;</p><p><span class="color-gray-03">用大到自己可以听见的声音朗读文章。</span></p><p>There are three benefits to this method, the first benefit is you become more engaged with the information because you are using your eyes and your ears. The second benefit is it helps you improve your pronunciation because you will begin to listen to yourself more intently. The more you read out loud, the more you will listen to yourself and you'll begin to see which words you're pronouncing correctly and which words you're not pronouncing correctly.The third benefit is reading&nbsp;out&nbsp;loud actually helps to improve&nbsp;your comprehension. It helps you to internalize the words you are reading.</p><p><span class="color-gray-03">这样做会有三个好处。首先，眼睛耳朵并用，会使你更专注于信息。其次，听见自己的声音，额可以帮助你提高发音。你会听到自己哪些单词发音准，哪些不准。最后，有助于提高你的阅读理解能力，因为你正在消化读到的每个单词。</span></p><p><br></p><h1><strong>M</strong><strong>ethod&nbsp;No.2</strong></h1><p><strong>Read various topics.</strong></p><p><strong><span class="color-gray-03">读各种话题</span></strong><br></p><p>After recognizing what topics you are interested in look for English material about those topics but remember to not simply focus on one topic. You want to get a variety of different topics</p><p><span class="color-gray-03">找到与你感兴趣的话题有关的英语材料，但不要只读这个话题，还要去读其他话题的材料。</span></p><p>You will be exposed to a wide variety of vocabulary words so your vocabulary will also improve.&nbsp; Number two, you will not become bored with your English studies because you will have different topics to read about.

What happens is when you first save the word, you're going to realize and notice that your tongue or your mouth has a hard time pronouncing certain parts of that word. The next time you say that you will actually focus on that part so that you can say it better. You will gain confidence in your ability to say the word, which will increase your fluency.</p><p><span class="color-gray-03">这样做会让你注意到单词中发音困的部分。你会发现自己的舌头和嘴巴对某个单词有发音困难，你就会多加练习并在下一次说得更好。这会提升你的自信心以及流利程度。</span></p><p><br></p><h1><strong>M</strong><strong>ethod&nbsp;No.4</strong></h1><p><strong>Read often daily.</strong></p><p><span class="color-gray-03"><strong>每天练习</strong></span></p><p>Try to read as often as possible you can choose to read every day or every other day but it is important to set aside a specific amount of time for reading.</p><p><span class="color-gray-03">尽可能多多阅读，每天或每隔一天，最重要的是一定要留出特定的阅读时间。</span></p><p>You can read for five minutes and then move up to twenty or thirty minutes.

You can take turns reading a sentence a paragraph or a page each.</p><p><span class="color-gray-03">找一个也在练习英语的朋友，选一篇文章一起读。可以是轮流读一句话、或是一页。</span></p><p>This will help you with your listening your speaking and your comprehension.
